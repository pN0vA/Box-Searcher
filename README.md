# Box-Searcher
It can search a box like a docker container if run in it or to it. If the code doesn't work well don't use user input.
# Instructions
You can use the code if you dont have access for example if you are on a programming playground website.


If you are using a website playground however I suggest using main1.rs as most sites don't let you use user input.
# Progress
- User Input only as of now.
- A lot more is coming as this will be a feature of a following project
